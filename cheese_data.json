            "desc": "Hudson Valley creamery, Four Fat Fowl, took its name from a colonial rental fee charged by the last landlord of Rensselaerswyck (what’s now Rensselaer county”), which amounted to a day’s labor, including ten to twenty bushels of wheat. Their small, bloomy rounds are delicately buttery, with hints of sun-dried wheat and sweet cream beneath its pillowy rind, making St. Stephen a true expression of local terroir. Serve with local, NY honey, fresh berries and something bubbly to drink."
